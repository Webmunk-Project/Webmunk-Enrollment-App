<p>Dear Webmunk Study Participant,</p>
 
Our study is now complete. Please uninstall the Study Browser Extension from your Chrome browser.
 
To do so, you can open your Chrome browser and click the extension icon on the top-right corner of your browser. If you donâ€™t see it, it may be hidden under the puzzle icon, which is visible in the upper right corner of the screenshot below.

<p>After clicking on the Study Browser Extension, a pop-up window should appear. If it does not, it may be hidden behind another browser window. On this pop-up window, you should have a task to Uninstall the extension. Please click on the text/link to uninstall.</p>
