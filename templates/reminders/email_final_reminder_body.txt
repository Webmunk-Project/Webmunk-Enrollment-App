Dear Webmunk Study Participant,
 
We are nearing the end of the online shopping study you are enrolled in. Before we close the study, we want to remind you to complete the next steps so that you can receive full compensation for your participation in the research study. You have outstanding tasks to complete. We will only be able to compensate you if you complete them before 12/12/2023.
 
Please open the Study Browser Extension that you have installed in your Chrome browser and click the links to complete the pending tasks. Once you have completed all of the required tasks, we will email you your gift card from GiftBit (gifts@giftbit.com).
 
To access your tasks, please click the extension icon on the top-right corner of your browser. If you donâ€™t see it, it may be hidden under the puzzle icon, which is visible in the upper right corner of the screenshot below.

After clicking on the Study Browser Extension, a pop-up window should appear. If it does not, it may be hidden behind another browser window.
